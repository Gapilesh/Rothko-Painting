# Rothko-Painting
The paintings invite you on an unpredictable journey and into an unknown dimension. Rothko's artworks pulsate because he used a special technique to create them. Brightly-defined boundaries between colours create depth and you inevitably plunge into it. Mark used blurred outlines and colours to awaken feelings in us.

#This repository is to practice using CSS and the Box Model to create a Rothko-style rectangular art piece.
